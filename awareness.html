            <p>Yes, even you can help us spread awareness on organ donation! Organise a short awareness session given by us at your office, college, school, club or anywhere else. Help us get more of your friends, colleagues, relatives and others know more about organ donation. Consider the following:</p>
            <p>India is struggling with acute shortage of organs for transplantation. It is estimated that more than a million people suffer with end stage organ failure, but only a handful of 3,500 transplants are performed annually. At least 15 patients die every day waiting for organs and every 10 minutes a new name is added to this waiting list. Undoubtedly, the demand far outstrips the availability of organs. And no one can escape the harsh reality.</p>
            <p>Awareness on organ donation, is therefore the only way out of this depressing scenario. The more potential donors there are, the more the likelihood of organs becoming available to save lives. Unfortunately, very people in India have any idea about organ donation, or how they could potentially help after their deaths.</p>
            <p>We are there to give a short presentation to anyone who is interested in an effort to encourage people to become organ donors, or at the very least – know more about organ donation.</p>
            <p>Our presentation is 25-30 minutes long which includes a short 5 minute film, and is followed by questions from the audience. We will then offer people the option of signing up for Donor Cards. We require an LCD and screen. We don’t charge for anything. All we need is your time.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested in having us come and present somewhere at any, time please write in to us at info@organindia.org or call us at +91-11-41838382, or toll free no. 1800-300-28223.</p>
